## ðŸ¤– optional extra credit opportunities

If you want to improve your grade (or you want a chance for a little more reflection or challenge) - you can take the time to do 1 or more of the following extra credit opportunities. 

(Remember - these are **optional!** I would love for you do them if you are interested or want the grade boost, but they are by no means required.)

### 1 - ðŸŽ¨ MoMA
Go to the Museum of Modern Art (CUNY students go [free with student ID!](https://www.moma.org/research-and-learning/education-partnerships/moma-cuny-partnerships)) and make sure to check out either Refik Anadol's A.I. project _Unsupervised_ (if you go before April 15, closes that day), _Never Alone_ (history of video games and interfaces), _Signals_ (a recent history of video art, video and the news, and "how video transformed the world"), or _Black Power Naps_ (an installation/library for practicing rest, through May 14). Write a reflection (at least 750 words) about what you see, and connect these art exhibits to your own experience as a student of computer science and someone making technology. What might you want to make, and why? How do these art pieces inspire, challenge, or make you think differently about technology's role in society? How does learning C++ today give you ideas about what technology you want to make in the future? Include 1 photo that you take (you can use your phone) of a piece that you found particularly interesting in the museum.

### 2 - ðŸ‘¾ Reflection: ChatGPT
Take 1 problem from the midterm exam, or a zyBooks lab from the course that you found interesting or challenging, and try to get [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to write a C++ program that provides the answer correctly. Write about your experience using the bot for this purpose - what prompts did you need to use, what questions did you need to ask? What was the give-and-take between you the chatbot? What were your surprises, successes, frustrations? What do you think about ChatGPT as a tool for writing code, or for learning code? What are your thoughts about ChatGPT as a student and a programmer moving forward? Show both your code, some of the bot's code, and your original written reflections here, at least 750 words. I am more interested in your own reflection on this _process_ than the final "product" of ChatGPT's code!

### 3 - ðŸš€ Up Goer Five
Check out the [xkcd cartoon "Up Goer Five"](https://xkcd.com/1133/). This a schematic of a rocket ship, but explained only in the simplest terms for someone who is not an engineer. Use pen and paper, or digital drawing if you like, to create a similar diagram of a C++ program that you create. The program should include at least 1 user-defined function and 1 class. Use your imagination to make a clear diagram, explaining the anatomy of how a program works to someone who has never coded - try to make it as simple as possible!

### how does this work?

- If you complete 1 extra credit assignment, it can boost your grade half a "step" - going from B to B+, C+ to B-, B+ to A-, for example.
- If your average in the class < 70% (but above 55%) and you complete 1 extra assignment, **you can receive a passing final grade in the class.**
- These assignments will still be graded - they need to be **original, thoughtful work** that you have put time and care into, in order to receive full points.  
- [Academic honesty](https://github.com/mab253/cpp_spring23/#academic-honesty-and-integrity), as always, applies. Do not plagiarize!

**These assignments are due to me via e-mail by May 15th, the last day of class, by 11:59pm.** I will only accept late work for these if you arrange it with me ahead of time. Have fun!
