## course description

This is an introduction to computing, intended for those majoring in computer¬†science and engineering. The course will cover the basics of how a computer works; variables and data types; branching, conditionals, and logic; loops and functions; and an introduction to algorithms and recursion. 

## what will we learn in this class?

- We will learn the basics of modern object-oriented programming with C++
- We will cultivate computational thinking in how we approach solving problems 
- We will learn about the iterative process of crafting programs and coding
- We will learn the importance (and joy!) of debugging (and patience!)
- We will think about the real-world context of programming as we grow as coders

## course format

This course will generally meet **in-person**, with a lecture 2 mornings per week (M/W). There is also a (required) recitation on Friday mornings with instructor Chunyu Yuan. 

üé• There will be times throughout the semester, approximately 1x per month, when I will film a lecture instead of giving one in-person. When I post a video instead, you will be free to watch it in your own time. These asynchronous lectures will be clearly marked on the schedule. In the case of any change in the schedule, I will announce this change ahead of time via Blackboard/e-mail. 

We will use an online textbook (zyBook) to guide us through learning C++. In the zyBooks platform, you will have readings with interactive homework exercises, as well as labs (like programming problem sets) from the same textbook.

Each week, zyBooks homework will be due:
- üìöreadings w/questions on **Wednesday** evenings, by 11:59pm
- ü•Ω lab assignments on **Fridays**, by 11:59pm

**NOTE**: Learning C++ is like learning any new language - it's important to keep practicing, immersing yourself, and moving forward, a little bit at a time. I highly suggest you start the readings early in the week so that our time in-person will be most useful to you! You won't need to submit the reading homework for grading until Wednesday night, but it will be helpful for you to avoid doing it all at once ... you can't cram becoming a programmer!

There will be a take-home mid-term exam in this course, and a final programming project. There is no final exam.

## materials and references

We will use zyBooks [(see above)](#course-format) as our online text. I recognize that there are many different ways of learning and that folks may want to practice with different tools, so I will also post other resources for every chapter: online tutorials, videos, and texts. There is _a lot_ of good "learning to program" material available out there ... These additional resources will be optional but recommended - if you experiment, you may find that a different method makes a concept click for you!

## tools we will use a lot

- Blackboard 
- [zyBooks](https://zybooks.com)
- [Discord](https://discord.com)
- [Repl.it](https://replit.com/)

## expectations and requirements
### how can I do well in this class?

- Stay _curious_ about programming and problem solving - there is something that brought you to coding in the first place! Try and focus on finding the puzzle-solving muscles in your brain and learning a (fun!) new way to express them, rather than worry about quickly coming to the correct answers. We're going to learn to code, but we will also learn to _think like a programmer._

- Take your _time_, and make sure you _give yourself time_ to do your reading/assignments ... we are going to cover a lot in this course, but the goal is not to rush through it. If the solution to a problem does not instantly reveal itself to you, _this is OK, this is great, this is part of the process!_ Programming involves a lot of sitting with challenges, breaking down complexities, trying and failing and trying again, and [devising sideways solutions that weren't obvious right away](https://xkcd.com/264/). Learning this rhythm is a big part of learning how to code. 

- Also, it is crucial that we build a space where everyone can stay curious and take their time. This class will be an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you require an academic accommodation.

## evaluation:
Grading breakdown:
- Participation/Attendance: 10%
- zyBooks Reading: 20%
- zyBooks Labs: 30%
- Mid-Term Exam: 20%
- Final Project: 20%

on late work:

**Late assignments drop 10% per day, starting after the due time.** (If you submit a zyBook reading 1 hour after the due date, for example, it already drops 10%. If you wait another 24 hours, it drops 20%.) 

If you have a reason for needing an extension, please reach out to me _before_ the due date for an assignment.

## academic honesty and integrity:

Plagiarism is "the act of presenting another person's ideas, research or writings as your own." [(CUNY)](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy). This is as true for writing code as it is for writing others' words and pretending that they are yours. 

It is important that everything you turn in for this class is your own work. I understand that collaborating with your classmates can be really helpful when learning programming - you are allowed to and encouraged to do this! However, the code you submit must reflect work you have done on your own. To outline some of the boundaries here, it is acceptable to:

- Discuss the course‚Äôs material with others in order to understand it better.
- Help a classmate identify a bug in their code
- Incorporate a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned work and that you cite the lines‚Äô origins.
- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course‚Äôs own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to assigned work.
- Whiteboarding solutions with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
- Working with a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

It is **not acceptable** to:

- Viewing another‚Äôs solution to an assessment and basing your own solution on it.
- Ask a classmate to see their solution to some assessment before submitting your own.
- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to an assessment when it is they, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to assessments online or elsewhere.
- Splitting an assessment‚Äôs workload with another individual and combining your work.
- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual 
- Using AI-based software that suggests or completes answers to questions or lines of code.

_These terms modified and inspired by Harvard's CS50's academic honesty policy, [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/honesty/)._

I have ways of checking on the originality of your code and assignments. Consequences for violating this academic honesty policy will be severe, including but not limited to failing the course.

You can find CCNY‚Äôs Acedemic Integrity Policy in full [here](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy).  Do not plagiarize. 

## contact and questions

üëæ Our class will have a Discord server for posting questions and communicating with each other. If you have a question about the programming material, I suggest you start by:

- taking a pause, have you put in some time trying to solve this problem on your own?
- taking a walk - maybe you can approach the problem in a new way?
- checking the Discord, did someone else already post a similar question?
- if your question is new, make a post! try to include as much of your thought process as you can 

If you are answering a question on Discord - try and be friendly, and respond in the way you would like a response yourself. Remember that you will be asking a question yourself @ some point in your programming journey! We all have something to learn and something to offer. 

Have a question about zyBooks, something not working the way it's supposed to? The zyBooks [FAQ platform](https://zybooks.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360004050694-Students) here is pretty great. If you can't find the answer to your question there, there is a team of people ready to answer your zyBooks questions (faster and better than I would!) at `support@zybooks.com`.

If you would like to ask a question privately, please e-mail me - I am available and I try to respond within 24 hours. You are also invited to schedule some virtual office hour time to talk, [here](https://www.cal.com/mab253). If you need a time that's not on this schedule, please e-mail me.
