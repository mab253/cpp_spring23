# üì° midterm groundrules

The midterm exam is **take-home.** You will have access to the assignment labeled "Midterm Exam" in zyBooks 30 min. after class on Wednesday 03.22.23, and you will be able to work on it on your own time anytime before it's due on Friday 03.24.23, at 9AM.

The midterm is take home and open book so that you can spend as much time as you need, in the place you need, with the tools that might best help you do well.

## you may:

- Consult documentation: zyBooks, online c++ reference material, any of the resources that are linked from the syllabus
    - Examples: üëç looking up how to use isupper() function, looking up the concept of integer rounding, looking at examples of `for` loops or any code we have done in-class
- Submit the results as many times as you need without penalty (like the labs)

## you may not:

- Turn in the midterm late for partial credit - I will accept what you have turned in by 9AM on Friday!
- Work with other students; this exam will be your own work only
- Use search engines and websites to search _specifically_ for exam problems + their solutions
    - Examples: üëé copying and pasting part of the exam problem into Google to see what similar solutions come up; copying and pasting in StackOverflow
- Use generative AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.) to code up your answer

I will be using similarity checker tools to check to see if student work resembles others, and also if student work resembles online and chat-generated content. Using the internet to copy solutions, plagiarizing others' code, and sharing exams are all violations of the [academy honesty policy](http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/), and may result in serious consequences, including failing the exam and possibly failing the course.
