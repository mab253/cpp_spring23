Discord intro documentation: [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord)

Discord is a good tool to learn in today's coding world: most workplaces will have some asynchronous chat/collaborative platform, and Discord is used for all sorts of jobs and organizing online communities ... maybe you've already used it for gaming. In our class, we will use the Discord platform for questions, discussions, sharing resources, etc:

## to start on our Discord server:
  - you will receive an invite link via your CCNY e-mail
  - you may create a new Discord account with your CCNY e-mail, or you may use an account you already have
  - you can name yourself anything that you want, but please make sure that your profile "About Me" includes your first name and last initial, so that we know who each other are - you can [customize your User or Server profile settings](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409388345495-Server-Profiles#h_01FGCPP3V7BS1QVCQQZ2YC0RXB) to adjust this
  - post a "hello world" message in the #general channel

## Discord tips
  - you can [customize the appearance](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/207260127-How-can-I-change-Discord-s-appearance-theme-) so it's easiest for you to read
  - you can use Markdown, a [markup language](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), in your messages, especially helpful for sharing and asking questions about code: [style guide here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)

fun fact - the backend for Discord is partially written in C++!
